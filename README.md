An addon to Meteor Client that adds modules and commands that were too useless to be added to Meteor directly. 
Also includes non merged PRs.

### How to use:  
- Download the latest release of this mod from the releases tab.
- Put it in your `.minecraft/mods` folder where you have installed Meteor.
- It will then add itself to the Meteor GUI and you can use it as normal.
