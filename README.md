An addon to Meteor Client that adds modules and commands that were too useless to be added to Meteor directly. 
Also includes unmerged PRs. Some features are blatantly stolen from other clients ([Cornos](https://github.com/cornos/Cornos), [BleachHack](https://github.com/BleachDrinker420/BleachHack)).

### How to use:  
- Download the latest release of this mod from the releases tab.
  - [Download 1.17](https://github.com/C10udburst/meteor-rejects/releases/download/latest-1.17/meteor-rejects-addon-0.0.4.jar)
  - [Download 1.16](https://github.com/C10udburst/meteor-rejects/releases/download/latest-1.16/meteor-rejects-addon-0.0.4.jar)
- Put it in your `.minecraft/mods` folder where you have installed Meteor.
- It will then add itself to the Meteor GUI and you can use it as normal.
